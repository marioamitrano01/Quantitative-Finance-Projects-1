## Monte Carlo & Deep Learning Crypto Portfolio Optimizer

A code I developed that optimizes cryptocurrency portfolios using a combination of Monte Carlo simulation and LSTM-based deep learning. The project retrieves historical price data from Binance, calculates log returns and volatility, and then determines the optimal portfolio allocation.

## Techniques Utilized

- **Monte Carlo Simulation:**  
  Generates random portfolio weights to simulate different portfolio outcomes, evaluating them based on expected returns and volatility to find the optimal allocation.

- **Deep Learning with LSTM:**  
  Uses an LSTM neural network to predict portfolio weights by learning patterns from historical log return data, optimizing for risk-adjusted performance.
