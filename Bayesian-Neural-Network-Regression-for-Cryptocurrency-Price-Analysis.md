# Bayesian Neural Network Regression for Cryptocurrency Price Analysis: Leveraging Stochastic Variational Inference, RidgeCV and Huber Regression

This project demonstrates the application of Bayesian Neural Networks using Pyro to analyze cryptocurrency prices. The model leverages techniques like Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI) for training, along with RidgeCV and Huber Regression for robust model initialization, using real data from the Binance API.

## Features

- **Bayesian Neural Networks:** Manage uncertainty in cryptocurrency price predictions.
- **Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI):** Efficient Bayesian inference using Pyro.
- **Advanced Model Initialization:** Incorporates RidgeCV and Huber Regression to inform priors.
- **Real Data Integration:** Fetches historical BTC and ETH data from the Binance API.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Displays results and model performance using Plotly.
